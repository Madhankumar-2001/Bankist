# Bankist

In this project, I have created a Bankist Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, we can learn various concepts such as the `forEach` loop, array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, method chaining, and functions such as `find`, `findIndex`, `some`, `every`, `flat`, and `flatMap`.
